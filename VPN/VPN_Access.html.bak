      VPN Access to this Lab:</span><br>
    This tab will explain everything you need to know about how to establish a
    secure software <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">VPN
      connection </a>to this lab.&nbsp; A VPN connection is required for you to
    interact with the systems and devices in this Lab.&nbsp; You'll also need to
    have an active reservation for this Lab.<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Stuff You Can
      (and Should) Do Prior to Your Reservation: </span><br>
    In order to establish a software VPN connection to this Lab, you must
    download and install Cisco's AnyConnect VPN Client software on any system
    you plan to use to connect to your Lab.&nbsp; (And it's ok if you don't
    do&nbsp; this until after your reservation has started.&nbsp; It's all
    good!)&nbsp; Here's how you download and install AnyConnect:<br>
    <ul>
      <li><a target="_blank" href="https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/anyconnect/">Download
          the Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client software.</a></li>

    <br>
    <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Emails You'll
      Recieve:</span><br>
    When your Lab reservation begins, you will receive several emails
    communicating important information about the status of your Lab.<br>
    <ol>
      <li>The first email is sent to you from the lab provisioning automation
        engine, and indicates that resources in your lab are in the process of
        being provisioned and tested.&nbsp; Your lab is NOT READY yet, but this
        email will give an estimate of when your Lab will be available.</li>
      <li>The second email will be sent to you when your Lab is fully
        provisioned, tested and READY for you to connect.&nbsp; In this email
        you'll find the&nbsp; information required by AnyConnect to establish a
        VPN connection to your Lab (Network IP Address, VPN Username, VPN
        Password).</li>
    </ol>
    <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Connecting to
      Your Lab:</span><br>
    Once you receive the email that says your Lab is ready, you can begin the
    VPN connection process.&nbsp; Here's how you establish a VPN connection to
    you Lab.<br>
