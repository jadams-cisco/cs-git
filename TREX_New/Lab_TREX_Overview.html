	<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Overview:</span><br>
	<p>
	Traditionally, routers have been tested using commercial traffic generators, while performance typically has been measured using packets per second (PPS) metrics. As router functionality and services have become more complex, stateful traffic generators have become necessary to provide more realistic application traffic scenarios. The advantages of realistic traffic generators are:
	<p/>
	<ul>
		<li>Providing more accurate performance numbers </li>
		<li>Finding real bottlenecks</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	TRex addresses these problems through an innovative and extendable software implementation and by leveraging standard and open SW and x86/UCS HW.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Generates and analyses L4-7 traffic and able to provide in one tool capabilities provided by commercial L7 tools. </li>
		<li>Stateful traffic generator based on pre-processing and smart replay of real traffic templates.</li>
		<li>Generates and <font color="#0082F1"><strong>amplifies</strong></font> both client and server side traffic.</li>
		<li>Customized functionality can be added. </li>
		<li>Scale to 200Gb/sec for one UCS ( using Intel 40Gb/sec NICS)</li>
		<li>Low cost </li>
		<li>Virtual interfaces support, enable TRex to be used in a fully virtual environment without physical NICs and the following example use cases: </li>
		<ul>
			<li>Amazon AWS </li>
			<li>Cisco LaaS</li>
			<li>TRex on your laptop</li>
			<li>Self-contained packaging that can be easily installed and deployed</li> 
		</ul>
	</ul>
